Things I am involved in now [^1]:

## üìä **Research**:

### Project: GENIAL - GEN<font color='#D55816'>IA</font>L: <font color='#D55816'>GEN</font>erative <font color='#D55816'>AI</font> Tools as a Catalyst for <font color='#D55816'>L</font>earning

<img src="https://github.com/LSE-DSI/genial/assets/896254/413df2b5-cabd-4fbf-94fa-3d50dcefbd22"  style="object-fit: cover;width:8em;height:8em;border-radius: 70%;"/>

A focus group led by my colleague, Dr [Marcos Barreto](https://marcosebarreto.github.io/) ([LSE Department of Statistics](https://lse.ac.uk/statistics)), and I. We want to explore the practical applications of Generative AI tools for education and understand how they might specifically enhance (or hurt) programming skills and critical thinking. We will design exercises and learning materials and test them on several undergraduate and a graduate course at LSE this coming academic year.

You can read more about it on the dedicated website [here](http://lse-dsi.github.io/genial).

### Project: DISCORDIA - Uncovering Patterns of Parliamentary Dissent

<img src="https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/jonjoncardoso/assets/896254/8b540043-bc9a-47f5-bd4f-8eb6ea09bfbb" style="object-fit: cover;width:8em;height:8em;border-radius: 70%;"/>

Led by me and a dedicated team of research assistants, this project explores the fascinating realm of political dissent within the UK Parliament. We aim to identify and understand the indicators in MPs' speeches at the House of Commons that may suggest a likelihood of rebelling against party lines. Using a combination of data science and political analysis, our goal is to gain insights into the patterns of parliamentary rebellion. We're experimenting with various machine learning models and investigating the use of explainable AI to enhance our analysis. The findings from this project are expected to shed light on the nuances of political discourse.

üñáÔ∏è A dedicated website will soon appear here soon

### VIMuRe

You can read about VIMuRe on paper recently published at JRSS A ([De Bacco et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnac004): "_Latent Network Models to Account for Noisy, Multiply Reported Social Network Data._"

- I am writing tutorials and maintaining the [VIMuRe](https://latentnetworks.github.io/vimure/) packages in R and Python.
- üó£Ô∏è At the end of June 2023, I will be in Portland, Oregon for the [**Sunbelt 2023**](https://www.insna.org/events/sunbelt-2023), teaching a workshop about `VIMuRe` alongside [Daniel Redhead](https://github.com/danielredhead ) & [Elly Power](https://github.com/eapower)  

## üßë‚Äçüè´ **Teaching**:

- I just finished teaching Summer School course about data engineering in R at LSE ([ME204 ‚Äî Data Engineering for the Social World](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/summer-schools/summer-school/courses/research-methods/me204)).

I have been preparing material for the upcoming academic year at LSE. I will teach the following courses in the 2023/24 academic year: [DS105](https://lse-dsi.github.io/DS105) and [DS202](https://lse-dsi.github.io/lse-ds202-course-notes).

- I have been working on [quarto-template-for-university-courses](https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/quarto-template-for-university-courses) for my upcoming undergraduate courses at LSE in 2023/24.


- üìñ I might be working on a _textbook_ too...
